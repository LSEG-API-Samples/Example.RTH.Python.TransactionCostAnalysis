# Building an end-to-end transaction cost analysis framework

### Authors: Haykaz Aramyan, Gurpreet Bal, Marios Skevofylakas

The projects consists of three modules:
* Trades Simulation - We expect users of this prototype will submit their own trades for enrichment and analysis. However, for those users interested in the simulation aspect, we have included the simulation module. More about the Simulation approach can be found in the introductory article [How to build an end-to-end transaction cost analysis framework](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/build-end-to-end-transaction-cost-analysis-framework).
* Trade Enrichment - We used LSEG Tick History API to enrich our trades with tick data. Check out more in [Trade data enrichment for Transaction Cost Analysis](https://developers.lseg.com/en/article-catalog/article/trade-data-enrichment-for-transaction-cost-analysis) article.
* Analysis and Visualisations - On top of calculating wide range of benchmarks and metrics, we have built a User Interface (UI) that implements a presentation layer visualizing our findings using Streamlit.
